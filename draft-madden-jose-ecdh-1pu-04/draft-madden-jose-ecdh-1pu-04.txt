         Public Key Authenticated Encryption for JOSE: ECDH-1PU
                     draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04

Abstract

   This document describes the ECDH-1PU public key authenticated
   encryption algorithm for JWE.  The algorithm is similar to the
   existing ECDH-ES encryption algorithm, but adds an additional ECDH
   key agreement between static keys of the sender and recipient.  This
   additional step allows the recipient to be assured of sender
   authenticity without requiring a nested signed-then-encrypted message
   structure.

Internet-Draft                JOSE ECDH-1PU                     May 2021


1.  Introduction

   JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) defines a number of
   encryption (JWE) [RFC7516] and digital signature (JWS) [RFC7515]
   algorithms.  When symmetric cryptography is used, JWE provides
   authenticated encryption that ensures both confidentiality and sender
   authentication.  However, for public key cryptography the existing
   JWE encryption algorithms provide only confidentiality and some level
   of ciphertext integrity.  When sender authentication is required,
   users must resort to nested signed-then-encrypted structures, which
   increases the overhead and size of resulting messages.  This document
   describes an alternative encryption algorithm called ECDH-1PU that
   provides public key authenticated encryption, allowing the benefits
   of authenticated encryption to be enjoyed for public key JWE as it
   currently is for symmetric cryptography.

   ECDH-1PU is based on the One-Pass Unified Model for Elliptic Curve
   Diffie-Hellman key agreement described in [NIST.800-56A].

   The advantages of public key authenticated encryption with ECDH-1PU
   compared to using nested signed-then-encrypted documents include the
   following:

   *  The resulting message size is more compact as an additional layer
      of headers and base64url-encoding is avoided.  A 500-byte payload
      when encrypted and authenticated with ECDH-1PU (with P-256 keys
      and "A256GCM" Content Encryption Method) results in a 1087-byte
      JWE in Compact Encoding.  An equivalent nested signed-then-
      encrypted JOSE message using the same keys and encryption method
      is 1489 bytes (37% larger).

   *  The same primitives are used for both confidentiality and
      authenticity, providing savings in code size for constrained
      environments.

   *  The generic composition of signatures and public key encryption
      involves a number of subtle details that are essential to security
      [PKAE].  Providing a dedicated algorithm for public key
      authenticated encryption reduces complexity for users of JOSE
      libraries.

   *  ECDH-1PU provides only authenticity and not the stronger security
      properties of non-repudiation or third-party verifiability.  This
      can be an advantage in applications where privacy, anonymity, or
      plausible deniability are goals.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

2.  Key Agreement with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman One-Pass Unified
    Model (ECDH-1PU)

   This section defines the specifics of key agreement with Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman One-Pass Unified Model, in combination with the
   one-step KDF, as defined in Section 5.8.2.1 of [NIST.800-56A] using
   the Concatenation Format of Section 5.8.2.1.1.  This is identical to
   the ConcatKDF function used by the existing JWE ECDH-ES algorithm
   defined in Section 4.6 of [RFC7518].  As for ECDH-ES, the key
   agreement result can be used in one of two ways:

   1.  directly as the Content Encryption Key (CEK) for the "enc"
       algorithm, in the Direct Key Agreement mode, or

   2.  as a symmetric key used to wrap the CEK with the "A128KW",
       "A192KW", or "A256KW" algorithms, in the Key Agreement with Key
       Wrapping mode.

   A fresh ephemeral public key value MUST be generated for each
   message.  When encrypting the message to multiple recipients using
   ECDH-1PU, the same ephemeral keys MAY be reused for multiple
   recipients [MRES].

   In Direct Key Agreement mode, the output of the KDF MUST be a key of
   the same length as that used by the "enc" algorithm.  In this case,
   the empty octet sequence is used as the JWE Encrypted Key value.  The
   "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter value "ECDH-1PU" is used in Direct
   Key Agreement mode.

   In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, the output of the KDF MUST
   be a key of the length needed for the specified key wrapping
   algorithm.  In this case, the JWE Encrypted Key is the CEK wrapped
   with the agreed-upon key.

   The following "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter values are used to
   indicate the JWE Encrypted Key is the result of encrypting the CEK
   using the result of the key agreement algorithm as the key encryption
   key for the corresponding key wrapping algorithm:

                                  Table 1

2.1.  Special Considerations for Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode

   In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, the JWE Authentication Tag
   is included in the input to the Key Derivation Function as described
   in section Section 2.3.  This ensures that the content of the JWE was
   produced by the original sender and not by another recipient, as
   described in section Section 4.

   Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode MUST only be used with content
   encryption algorithms that are compactly committing AEADs as
   described in [ccAEAD].  The AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 algorithms described in
   section 5.2 of [RFC7518] are compactly committing and can be used
   with ECDH-1PU in Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode.  Other content
   encryption algorithms MUST be rejected.  In Direct Key Agreement
   mode, any JWE content encryption algorithm MAY be used.

   The requirement to include the JWE Authentication Tag in the input to
   the Key Derivation Function implies an adjustment to the order of
   operations performed during JWE Message Encryption described in
   section 5.1 of [RFC7516].  Steps 3-8 are deferred until after step
   15, using the randomly generated CEK from step 2 for encryption of
   the message content.

2.2.  Header Parameters used for ECDH Key Agreement

   The "epk" (ephemeral public key), "apu" (Agreement PartyUInfo), and
   "apv" (Agreement PartyVInfo) header parameters are used in ECDH-1PU
   exactly as defined in Section 4.6.1 of [RFC7518].

   When no other values are supplied, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   producer software initializes the "apu" header to the base64url-
   encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of the sender's
   static public key and the ephemeral public key, and the "apv" header

Internet-Draft                JOSE ECDH-1PU                     May 2021


   to the base64url-encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the recipient's
   static public key.  This ensures that all keys involved in the key
   agreement are cryptographically bound to the derived keys.

2.2.1.  "skid" Header Parameter

   A new Header Parameter "skid" (Sender Key ID) is registered as a hint
   as to which of the sender's keys was used to authenticate the JWE.
   The structure of the "skid" value is unspecified.  Its value MUST be
   a case-sensitive string.  Use of this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.
   When used with a JWK, the "skid" value is used to match a JWK "kid"
   parameter value [RFC7517].

2.3.  Key Derivation for ECDH-1PU Key Agreement

   The key derivation process derives the agreed-upon key from the
   shared secret Z established through the ECDH algorithm, per
   Section 6.2.1.2 of [NIST.800-56A].  For the NIST prime order curves
   "P-256", "P-384", and "P-521", the ECC CDH primitive for cofactor
   Diffie-Hellman defined in Section 5.7.1.2 of [NIST.800-56A] is used
   (taking note that the cofactor for all these curves is 1).  For
   curves "X25519" and "X448" the appropriate ECDH primitive from
   Section 5 of [RFC7748] is used.

   Key derivation is performed using the one-step KDF, as defined in
   Section 5.8.1 and Section 5.8.2.1 of [NIST.800-56A] using the
   Concatenation Format of Section 5.8.2.1.1, where the Auxilary
   Function H is SHA-256.  The KDF parameters are set as follows:

   Z  This is set to the representation of the shared secret Z as an
      octet sequence.  As per Section 6.2.1.2 of [NIST.800-56A] Z is the
      concatenation of Ze and Zs, where Ze is the shared secret derived
      from applying the ECDH primitive to the sender's ephemeral private
      key and the recipient's static public key (when sending) or the
      recipient's static private key and the sender's ephemeral public
      key (when receiving).  Zs is the shared secret derived from
      applying the ECDH primitive to the sender's static private key and
      the recipient's static public key (when sending) or the
      recipient's static private key and the sender's static public key
      (when receiving).

   keydatalen  This is set to the number of bits in the desired output
      key.  For "ECDH-1PU", this is the length of the key used by the
      "enc" algorithm.  For "ECDH-1PU+A128KW", "ECDH-1PU+A192KW", and
      "ECDH-1PU+A256KW", this is 128, 192, and 256, respectively.

   cctag  In Direct Key Agreement mode this is set to an empty octet

      string.  In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, this is set to a
      value of the form Datalen || Data, where Data is the raw octets of
      the JWE Authentication Tag, and Datalen is the big-endian 32-bit
      length of the authentication tag (in octets).

   AlgorithmID  The AlgorithmID value is of the form Datalen || Data,
      where Data is a variable-length string of zero or more octets, and
      Datalen is a fixed-length, big-endian 32-bit counter that
      indicates the length (in octets) of Data.  In the Direct Key
      Agreement case, Data is set to the octets of the ASCII
      representation of the "enc" Header Parameter value.  In the Key
      Agreement with Key Wrapping case, Data is set to the octets of the
      ASCII representation of the "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter
      value.

   PartyUInfo  The PartyUInfo value is of the form Datalen || Data,
      where Data is a variable-length string of zero or more octets, and
      Datalen is a fixed-length, big-endian 32-bit counter that
      indicates the length (in octets) of Data.  If an "apu" (agreement
      PartyUInfo) Header Parameter is present, Data is set to the result
      of base64url decoding the "apu" value and Datalen is set to the
      number of octets in Data.  Otherwise, Datalen is set to 0 and Data
      is set to the empty octet sequence.

   PartyVInfo  The PartyVInfo value is of the form Datalen || Data,
      where Data is a variable-length string of zero or more octets, and
      Datalen is a fixed-length, big-endian 32-bit counter that
      indicates the length (in octets) of Data.  If an "apv" (agreement
      PartyVInfo) Header Parameter is present, Data is set to the result
      of base64url decoding the "apv" value and Datalen is set to the
      number of octets in Data.  Otherwise, Datalen is set to 0 and Data
      is set to the empty octet sequence.

   SuppPubInfo  This is set to the keydatalen represented as a 32-bit
      big-endian integer followed by the octets of the cctag.

   SuppPrivInfo  This is set to the empty octet sequence.

   Applications need to specify how the "apu" and "apv" Header
   Parameters are used for that application.  The "apu" and "apv" values
   MUST be distinct, when used.  Applications wishing to conform to
   [NIST.800-56A] need to provide values that meet the requirements of
   that document, e.g., by using values that identify the producer and
   consumer.

   See Appendix A for an example key agreement computation using Direct
   Key Agreement mode, and Appendix B for an example sending to multiple
   recipients using Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC7516] and [RFC7518] relevant to
   ECDH-ES also apply to this specification.

   The security considerations of [NIST.800-56A] apply here.

   When performing an ECDH key agreement between a static private key
   and any untrusted public key, care should be taken to ensure that the
   public key is a valid point on the same curve as the private key.
   Failure to do so may result in compromise of the static private key.
   For the NIST curves P-256, P-384, and P-521, appropriate validation
   routines are given in Section 5.6.2.3.3 of [NIST.800-56A].  For the
   curves used by X25519 and X448, consult the security considerations
   of [RFC7748].

   The ECDH-1PU algorithm is vulnerable to Key Compromise Impersonation
   (KCI) attacks.  If the long-term static private key of a party is
   compromised, then the attacker can not only impersonate that party to
   other parties, but also impersonate any other party when
   communicating with the compromised party.  If resistance to KCI is
   desired in a single message, then the sender SHOULD use a nested JWS
   signature over the content.

   come from the original sender.  If the MAC used by the content
   encryption algorithm is not compactly committing ([ccAEAD]) then it
   may be possible for a recipient to calculate an alternative message
   that produces the same authentication tag.  An alternative is to
   encrypt the message separately to each recipient using Direct Key
   Agreement, or to sign the message using a nested signed-then-
   encrypted JOSE composition.

   The security properties of the one-pass unified model are given in
   Section 7.3 of [NIST.800-56A].

Appendix A.  Example ECDH-1PU Key Agreement Computation with A256GCM

   This example uses ECDH-1PU in Direct Key Agreement mode ("alg" value
   "ECDH-1PU") to produce an agreed-upon key for AES GCM with a 256-bit
   key ("enc" value "A256GCM").  The example re-uses the keys and
   parameters of the example computation in Appendix C of [RFC7518],
   with the addition of an extra static key-pair for Alice.

   In this example, a producer Alice is encrypting content to a consumer
   Bob. Alice's static key-pair (in JWK format) used for the key
   agreement in this example (including the private part) is:

         {"kty":"EC",
          "crv":"P-256",
          "x":"WKn-ZIGevcwGIyyrzFoZNBdaq9_TsqzGl96oc0CWuis",
          "y":"y77t-RvAHRKTsSGdIYUfweuOvwrvDD-Q3Hv5J0fSKbE",
          "d":"Hndv7ZZjs_ke8o9zXYo3iq-Yr8SewI5vrqd0pAvEPqg"}

   Bob's static key-pair (in JWK format) is:

         {"kty":"EC",
          "crv":"P-256",
          "x":"weNJy2HscCSM6AEDTDg04biOvhFhyyWvOHQfeF_PxMQ",

          "d":"VEmDZpDXXK8p8N0Cndsxs924q6nS1RXFASRl6BfUqdw"}

   The producer (Alice) generates an ephemeral key for the key agreement
   computation.  Alice's ephemeral key (in JWK format) is:

   Header Parameter values used in this example are as follows.  The
   "apu" (agreement PartyUInfo) Header Parameter value is the base64url
   encoding of the UTF-8 string "Alice" and the "apv" (agreement
   PartyVInfo) Header Parameter value is the base64url encoding of the
   UTF-8 string "Bob".  The "epk" (ephemeral public key) Header
   Parameter is used to communicate the producer's (Alice's) ephemeral
   public key value to the consumer (Bob).

        {"alg":"ECDH-1PU",
         "enc":"A256GCM",
         "apu":"QWxpY2U",

   This example uses ECDH-1PU in Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode
   ("alg" value "ECDH-1PU+A128KW") to encrypt a JWE for multiple
   recipients using the JWE JSON Serialization.  The example uses X25519
   key pairs, as described in [RFC8037].  Alice is sending an identical
   message to Bob and Charlie.  Because Bob and Charlie are using the
   same curve (X25519), Alice reuses the same ephemeral key-pair for
   both recipients and includes it in the JWE Protected Header.  If this
   was not the case, Alice should generate a separate ephemeral key-pair
   for each recipient and include it in each per-recipient header
   instead.

   Alice's static key pair, represented as an OKP JWK (including the
   private component) is:

B.9.  Key Agreement for Bob

   The KDF input parameters for Bob are as follows:

   Ze  This is set to the ECDH key agreement output between Alice's
      ephemeral private key and Bob's static public key.  In this
      example, Ze is the following octet sequence (in hexadecimal):

               32 81 08 96 e0 fe 4d 57 0e d1 ac fc ed f6 71 17
               dc 19 4e d5 da ac 21 d8 ff 7a f3 24 46 94 89 7f

   Zs  This is set to the ECDH key agreement output between Alice's
      static private key and Bob's static public key.  In this example,
      Zs is the following octet sequence (in hexadecimal):

               21 57 61 2c 90 48 ed fa e7 7c b2 e4 23 71 40 60
               59 67 c0 5c 7f 77 a4 8e ea f2 cf 29 a5 73 7c 4a

   Z  Z is the concatenation of Ze followed by Zs.  In this example, the
      value of Z is:

               32 81 08 96 e0 fe 4d 57 0e d1 ac fc ed f6 71 17
               dc 19 4e d5 da ac 21 d8 ff 7a f3 24 46 94 89 7f
               21 57 61 2c 90 48 ed fa e7 7c b2 e4 23 71 40 60
               59 67 c0 5c 7f 77 a4 8e ea f2 cf 29 a5 73 7c 4a

   keydatalen  This value is 128 - the number of bits in the desired
      output key (because "ECDH-1PU+A128KW" uses a 128-bit key-wrapping
      key).
   cctag  This is set to the octets of the JWE Authentication Tag,
      prefixed by the length of the authentication tag (number of
      octets) as a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer.  For the
      "A256CBC-HS512" algorithm used in this example, the tag is 32
      octets in size (00 00 00 20 in hex).  The complete value of the
      cctag parameter for this example (in hex) is:

               00 00 00 20 1c b6 f8 7d 39 66 f2 ca 46 9a 28 f7
               47 23 ac da 02 78 0e 91 cc e2 18 55 47 07 45 fe
               11 9b dd 64

               47 07 45 fe 11 9b dd 64

   SuppPrivInfo  This is set to the empty octet sequence.

   Concatenating the parameters AlgorithmID through SuppPrivInfo results
   in a FixedInfo value in Concatenation Format (as per
   Section 5.8.2.1.1 of [NIST.800-56A] of (in hexadecimal notation):

B.10.  Key Agreement for Charlie

   The KDF input parameters for Charlie are as follows:

   Ze  This is set to the ECDH key agreement output between Alice's
      ephemeral private key and Charlie's static public key.  In this
      example, Ze is the following octet sequence (in hexadecimal):

   Zs  This is set to the ECDH key agreement output between Alice's
      static private key and Charlie's static public key.  In this
      example, Zs is the following octet sequence (in hexadecimal):

               ed 5e 20 a9 16 81 85 fd ee dc a1 c3 d8 e6 a6 1c

   Z  Z is the concatenation of Ze followed by Zs.  In this example, the
      value of Z is:

               89 dc fe 4c 37 c1 dc 02 71 f3 46 b5 b3 b1 9c 3b

   The FixedInfo value is identical to that computed for Bob.
   Concatenating the round number 1 (00 00 00 01), Z, and the FixedInfo
   value results in a one-pass KDF round 1 hash input of (hexadecimal):
