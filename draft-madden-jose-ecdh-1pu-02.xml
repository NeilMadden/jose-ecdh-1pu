                This document describes the ECDH-1PU public key authenticated encryption algorithm
                for JWE. The algorithm is similar to the existing ECDH-ES encryption algorithm, but
                adds an additional ECDH key agreement between static keys of the sender and recipient.
                This additional step allows the recipient to be assured of sender authenticity without
                requiring a nested signed-then-encrypted message structure.

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
            <t>
                JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) defines a number of encryption (JWE) 
                <xref target="RFC7516"/> and digital signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"/> 
                algorithms.  When symmetric cryptography is used, JWE provides authenticated
                encryption that ensures both confidentiality and sender authentication. However,
                for public key cryptography the existing JWE encryption algorithms provide only
                confidentiality and some level of ciphertext integrity. When sender authentication
                is required, users must resort to nested signed-then-encrypted structures, which
                increases the overhead and size of resulting messages. This document describes an
                alternative encryption algorithm called ECDH-1PU that provides public key
                authenticated encryption, allowing the benefits of authenticated encryption to be
                enjoyed for public key JWE as it currently is for symmetric cryptography.
            </t>

            <t>
                ECDH-1PU is based on the One-Pass Unified Model for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
                key agreement described in <xref target="NIST.800-56A"/>. 
            </t>

            <t>
                The advantages of public key authenticated encryption with ECDH-1PU compared to
                using nested signed-then-encrypted documents include the following:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>
                        The resulting message size is more compact as an additional layer of headers
                        and base64url-encoding is avoided. A 500-byte payload when encrypted and
                        authenticated with ECDH-1PU (with P-256 keys and "A256GCM" Content Encryption
                        Method) results in a 1087-byte JWE in Compact Encoding. An equivalent nested 
                        signed-then-encrypted JOSE message using the same keys and encryption method 
                        is 1489 bytes (37% larger).
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The same primitives are used for both confidentiality and authenticity,
                        providing savings in code size for constrained environments.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The generic composition of signatures and public key encryption involves
                        a number of subtle details that are essential to security <xref target="PKAE"/>.
                        Providing a dedicated algorithm for public key authenticated encryption
                        reduces complexity for users of JOSE libraries.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        ECDH-1PU provides only authenticity and not the stronger security properties of
                        non-repudiation or third-party verifiability. This can be an advantage in
                        applications where privacy, anonymity, or plausible deniability are goals.

            <t>
                This section defines the specifics of key agreement with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
                One-Pass Unified Model, in combination with the one-step KDF, as defined in
                Section 5.8.2.1 of <xref target="NIST.800-56A"/> using the Concatenation Format of
                Section 5.8.2.1.1. This is identical to the ConcatKDF function used by the existing
                JWE ECDH-ES algorithm defined in Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC7518"/>. As for ECDH-ES,
                the key agreement result can be used in one of two ways:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>directly as the Content Encryption Key (CEK) for the "enc" algorithm, in the
                        Direct Key Agreement mode, or</t>
                    <t>as a symmetric key used to wrap the CEK with the "A128KW", "A192KW", or "A256KW"
                        algorithms, in the Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                A new ephemeral public key value MUST be generated for each key agreement operation.
            </t>
            <t>
                In Direct Key Agreement mode, the output of the KDF MUST be a key of the same length
                as that used by the "enc" algorithm. In this case, the empty octet sequence is used
                as the JWE Encrypted Key value. The "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter value "ECDH-1PU"
                is used in Direct Key Agreement mode.
            </t>
            <t>
                In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, the output of the KDF MUST be a key of the length
                needed for the specified key wrapping algorithm. In this case, the JWE Encrypted Key is
                the CEK wrapped with the agreed-upon key.
            </t>
            <t>
                The following "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter values are used to indicate the JWE
                Encrypted Key is the result of encrypting the CEK using the result of the key agreement
                algorithm as the key encryption key for the corresponding key wrapping algorithm:

                    The "epk" (ephemeral public key), "apu" (Agreement PartyUInfo), and "apv" (Agreement PartyVInfo)
                    header parameters are used in ECDH-1PU exactly as defined in Section 4.6.1 of
                    <xref target="RFC7518"/>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    When no other values are supplied, it is RECOMMENDED that the producer software
                    initializes the "apu" header to the base64url-encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the
                    concatenation of the sender's static public key and the ephemeral public key, and
                    the "apv" header to the base64url-encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the recipient's
                    static public key. This ensures that all keys involved in the key agreement are
                    cryptographically bound to the derived keys.

                        A new Header Parameter "skid" (Sender Key ID) is registered as a hint as to which 
                        of the sender's keys was used to authenticate the JWE. The structure of the "skid"
                        value is unspecified. Its value MUST be a case-sensitive string. Use of this Header
                        Parameter is OPTIONAL. When used with a JWK, the "skid" value is used to match a JWK
                        "kid" parameter value <xref target="RFC7517"/>.

                <t>
                    The key derivation process derives the agreed-upon key from the shared secret Z
                    established through the ECDH algorithm, per Section 6.2.1.2 of <xref target="NIST.800-56A"/>.
                    For the NIST prime order curves "P-256", "P-384", and "P-521", the ECC CDH primitive
                    for cofactor Diffie-Hellman defined in Section 5.7.1.2 of <xref target="NIST.800-56A"/> is
                    used (taking note that the cofactor for all these curves is 1). For curves "X25519" and
                    "X448" the appropriate ECDH primitive from Section 5 of <xref target="RFC7748"/> is used.

                    Key derivation is performed using the one-step KDF, as defined in Section 5.8.1 and

                    Section 5.8.2.1.1, where the Auxilary Function H is SHA-256. The KDF parameters

        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                The security considerations of <xref target="RFC7516"/> and <xref target="RFC7518"/> 
                relevant to ECDH-ES also apply to this specification.
            </t>
            <t>The security considerations of <xref target="NIST.800-56A"/> apply here.</t>

            <t>
                When performing an ECDH key agreement between a static private key and any untrusted
                public key, care should be taken to ensure that the public key is a valid point on
                the same curve as the private key. Failure to do so may result in compromise of the
                static private key. For the NIST curves P-256, P-384, and P-521, appropriate validation
                routines are given in Section 5.6.2.3.3 of <xref target="NIST.800-56A"/>. For the curves
                used by X25519 and X448, consult the security considerations of <xref target="RFC7748"/>.
            </t>

            <t>
                The ECDH-1PU algorithm is vulnerable to Key Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attacks. If
                the long-term static private key of a party is compromised, then the attacker can not
                only impersonate that party to other parties, but also impersonate any other party when
                communicating with the compromised party. If resistance to KCI is desired in a single 
                message, then it is RECOMMENDED to use a nested JWS signature over the content. An interactive
                handshake protocol, such as those described in <xref target="Noise"/> can also be used
                to prevent KCI.
            </t>

            <t>
                When Key Agreement with Key Wrapping is used, with the same Content Encryption Key (CEK)
                reused for multiple recipients, any of those recipients can produce a new message that
                appears to come from the original sender. The new message will be indistinguishable from 
                a genuine message from the original sender to any of the other participants. The sender
                SHOULD use a unique CEK for each recipient of a message.
            </t>

            <t>
                The security properties of the one-pass unified model are given in Section 7.3 of
                <xref target="NIST.800-56A"/>.

      <section anchor="example" title="Example ECDH-1PU Key Agreement Computation with A256GCM">
          <t>
              This example uses ECDH-1PU in Direct Key Agreement mode ("alg" value "ECDH-1PU")
              to produce an agreed-upon key for AES GCM with a 256-bit key ("enc" value "A256GCM").
              The example re-uses the keys and parameters of the example computation in Appendix C
              of <xref target="RFC7518"/>, with the addition of an extra static key-pair for Alice.
          </t>
          <t>
              When used in this way, ECDH-1PU has similar security properties to the "K" one-way
              handshake pattern of <xref target="Noise"/>, although it is quite different in details.
          </t>
          <t>
              In this example, a producer Alice is encrypting content to a consumer Bob. Alice's
              static key-pair (in JWK format) used for the key agreement in this example (including
              the private part) is:

           Header Parameter values used in this example are as follows.  The

           encoding of the UTF-8 string "Alice" and the "apv" (agreement
           PartyVInfo) Header Parameter value is the base64url encoding of the
           UTF-8 string "Bob".  The "epk" (ephemeral public key) Header
           Parameter is used to communicate the producer's (Alice's) ephemeral
           public key value to the consumer (Bob).
